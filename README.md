2nd attempt at a README files. I created the first, and forgot to git push. Before I figured that out, I took the easy way out and greated a readme through the browser on github. THis caused me a headache of 2 paralell but slightly different files. The upside: I just learned how to use the git pull and git merge with ease...and will remember to push my changes in the future. Hopefully.
